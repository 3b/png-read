Portable Network Graphics (PNG) decoder for Common Lisp.

All critical chunks are implemented. No ancillary chunks are. No interlacing is implemented. It should be able to read back any file produced by ZPNG.

Usage: read-png-file (file) and read-png-datastream (stream), both return a png-state object and a boolean to indicate if CRC was successful,
which most interesting property is image-data, a two (grayscale) or three dimensional array containing image data. Other properties are width, height, bit-depth and colour-type.
